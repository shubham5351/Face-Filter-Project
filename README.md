# Face-Filter-Project

In this project I have created a face filter project which is somewhat similar to SnapChat filter that will add glasses and moustache on the face of a person by detecting the keypoints on the face. For the detection of the face I have used cascade files which are already available else you can create your own cascade files i.e xml files.

## Libraries Used
